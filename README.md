# `tf-pid-tools`

**Transfer Function Identification & PID Auto-Tuning in Python**

`tf-pid-tools` is a Python library that combines **transfer function identification from data** with **PID controller tuning and optimization**.
It is designed for engineers, researchers, and hobbyists working in control systems who need fast prototyping, automatic tuning, and an interactive UI to visualize results.

## âœ¨ Features

- **PID Controller Class**
  - Clean, reusable PID implementation with `Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`
  - Easy simulation with `python-control` library

- **Transfer Function Identification**
  - Identify continuous-time transfer functions from inputâ€“output data
  - Optimize numerator & denominator coefficients using `scipy.optimize`
  - MSE-based cost function
  - Bound constraints to ensure stability

- **PID Auto-Tuning**
  - Zieglerâ€“Nichols closed-loop method (when possible)
  - IMC-based tuning fallback
  - Custom cost function optimization with adjustable weight sliders
  - Interactive **Tkinter app** for tuning and visualization
